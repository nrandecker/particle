# Contributing

Contributing is welcome but not necessary as this repo is more of a learning experience for me.

## Contributing anyway

Alright so you feel like you want to help, well some guidelines to submitting code:

* Make sure the code is well commented.
* Try not to go overboard. Remember, I'm trying to use github for keeping my code organized and for learning, I don't need the entire project done for me.
